# ElongationInfo

class [ElongationInfo](index.md)(time: [Time](../-time/index.md), visibility: [Visibility](../-visibility/index.md), elongation: [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html), eclipticSeparation: [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html))

Contains information about the visibility of a celestial body at a given date and time.

See [elongation](elongation.md) for more detailed information about the members of this class. See also [searchMaxElongation](../search-max-elongation.md) for how to search for maximum elongation events.
